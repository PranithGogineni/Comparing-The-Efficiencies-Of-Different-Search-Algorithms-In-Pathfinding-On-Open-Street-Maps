# Comparing-The-Efficiencies-Of-Different-Search-Algorithms-In-Pathfinding-On-Open-Street-Maps
Which algorithm( A*, Dijkstra, BFS, GBFS) offers the best balance of speed, computational efficiency, and path accuracy when applied to a real-world, spatially embedded, weighted graph? 
4 files are uploaded in the repository:
- New york
- Cambridge
- Delhi
- AstarvsDijkstras
Apart from the AstarvsDijkstras file, the other 3 files have all 4 algorithms, ready to be implemented with defined start and goal nodes. We can change the location by simply loading a different location and setting precise start and goal nodes.
AstarvsDijkstras file has only the A* and Dijkstra algorithms, this file can be used to view the differences between these 2 competing algorithms.
NOTE: All files are python files(.py).
